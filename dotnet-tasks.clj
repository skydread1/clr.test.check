(ns dotnet-tasks

  "Dotnet related tasks such as compiling and testing on the clr using `magic` and `nostrand`

  ## Motivation

  This namespace is dedicated to
  - compiling the `test.check` project into .NET dll
  - running the `test.check` tests on the cl

  ## Use case

  To compile a project from clojure to .net, we need the `nasser/magic` project.
  Another project called `nasser/nostrand` was made to simplify the compiler setup and use.

  `nasser/nostrand` runs a clojure function that describes the files to be compiled."
